# Network-analysis-of-students-interaction
This repository contains the network analysis of the students  interactions of the primary school

**Objective of the paper:**
The objective of the paper is to portray and understand contacts between youngsters at school that would help evaluate the transmission chances of respiratory diseases and recognize circumstances inside schools where the danger of transmission is higher.
An exact portrayal and comprehension of the contacts between youngsters at the school level would assist with evaluating the transmission chances of respiratory diseases, and to recognize the circumstances during school days where the danger of transmission is higher.


**Data Collection method:**
A closeness detecting framework dependent on radio-frequency identification devices (RFID) was deployed in a French primary school, and utilized it to gather, in an unsupervised way, time-resolved information on the face-to-face vicinity of youngsters and educators.
Data on face-to-face interactions were gathered on Thursday, October first and Friday, October second 2009. The data recorded 77,602 contact occasions between 242 people (232 kids and 10 educators). In this setting, every kid has on normal 323 contacts each day with 47 different youngsters, prompting a normal day by day association season of 176 minutes.

**About the network:**
The network provided is an undirected edge list. The nodes contain the attributes name, label, class name, gender. The edge contains attributes source, target, weight and count. The weights are removed for network edges with weights that are less than the median value of the original primary school network, and thus allows us to visualize the remaining edge weights as standardized edge “widths”.
An initial check on the nodes and edges suggests that there are 238 nodes (i.e., the children in the primary school) and 3125 undirected edges of varying weights(i.e., the interactions between the children and teachers).
After network is also a simplified one and all edges are strongly connected.
